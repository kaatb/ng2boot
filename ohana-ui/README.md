# Install
Run the `npmInstall` Gradle Task.

# Running stuff
Check [package.json](./src/package.json)'s `scripts` to see which project specific commands I've provided.

e.g. `npm run ngSingleTest`.

If you want to run other Angular CLI tasks that take dashed arguments you'll have to run like so `npm run ng task -- -arg1 arg2`.
